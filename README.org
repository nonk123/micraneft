* Micraneft

A console-based platformer for Windows.

- =A= and =D= to walk.
- Space to jump.
- Click to place/break blocks.
- Esc to exit.

Some plans for the future:
- Actually readable code (an impossible goal).
- +Breaking and placing blocks.+
- +Semi+-proper world generation.
- Basic networked multiplayer.

* Building

This game is meant to be built with MSVC Build Tools 2019.

Open a "native tools command prompt" in the source folder, and run
=nmake=. You can then start micraneft.exe by double-clicking it. The
=nmake clean= target is also available; it will remove the executable,
and relevant .obj files.
