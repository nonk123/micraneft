* Micraneft

A console-based platformer for Windows.

- Use =WAD= and/or arrow keys to move.
- Press =ESC= to exit.

If you accidentally click on the console window while the game is
running, press any key to unfreeze it.

Some plans for the future:
- Actually readable code (an impossible goal).
- Breaking and placing blocks.
- +Semi+-proper world generation.
- Basic networked multiplayer.

* Building

The game is meant to be built with MSVC Build Tools 2019.

Open a "native tools command prompt" in the source folder, and run
=nmake=. You can then start micraneft.exe by double-clicking it. The
=nmake clean= target is also available; it will remove the executable,
and relevant .obj files.
