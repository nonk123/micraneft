* Micraneft

A console-based platformer for Windows.

- Use =WAD= and/or arrow keys to move.
- Press =ESC= to exit.

If you accidentally click on the console window while the game is
running, try right-clicking it. Be wary though: if you have any text in
the clipboard, it will be inserted character by character, possibly
freezing the game.

Some plans for the future:
- Actually readable code.
- Breaking and placing blocks.
- Proper world generation.
- Basic networked multiplayer.

* Building

The game is meant to be built with MSVC Build Tools 2019.

Open a "native tools command prompt" in the source folder, and run
=nmake=. You can then start micraneft.exe by double-clicking it. The
=nmake clean= target is also available; it will remove the executable
and all the .obj files.
